# Solana Arbitrage Bot

## 🚀 Introduction
This is a high-performance Solana arbitrage bot that scans decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Solana blockchain to identify and execute profitable trades automatically. The bot leverages Solana's fast transactions and low fees to capitalize on price differences between various DEXs.

## 📌 Features
- ✅ **Real-time price monitoring** across multiple Solana-based DEXs
- ✅ **Fast execution** using Solana's low-latency transactions
- ✅ **Optimized arbitrage strategy** to maximize profits
- ✅ **Automatic trade execution** when profitable opportunities arise
- ✅ **Configurable parameters** for risk management and strategy tuning

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The bot continuously fetches token prices from multiple Solana DEXs.
2. It identifies potential arbitrage opportunities by comparing price differences.
3. When a profitable trade is detected, the bot executes the trade using a predefined strategy.
4. Profits are accumulated in the user's Solana wallet.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (or Python if the bot is written in Python)
- Solana CLI
- Phantom or Sollet wallet
- RPC node access (e.g., QuickNode, Alchemy, or public Solana RPCs)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bitfancy/solana-arbitrage-bot.git
   cd solana-arbitrage-bot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt if using Python
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY="your_wallet_private_key"
   RPC_URL="your_solana_rpc_url"
   ```
4. Run the bot:
   ```sh
   npm start  # or python bot.py if using Python
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration
You can customize the bot's behavior using a configuration file (`config.json` or `.env` variables). Key parameters include:
- **Trade threshold**: Minimum profit required before executing a trade
- **Slippage tolerance**: Maximum acceptable price slippage
- **DEX selection**: Which DEXs to include in the arbitrage search

## ⚠️ Risks & Considerations
- **Market volatility**: Prices can change rapidly, affecting profitability.
- **Transaction failures**: Network congestion or RPC issues may cause failed transactions.
- **Security**: Never expose your private keys. Use environment variables for sensitive information.
